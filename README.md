# Transabel
Transabel Technology is an India based company focusing on transformative labeling technologies and developing models of artificial intelligence at reduced cost. Amongst others, one domain of application is dental X-Ray image analysis.

# Dantset
Transabel releases a dataset, namely Dantset (Hindi: दंत [dant], English: Tooth), consisting of 5000 dental intra oral periapical radiograph (IOPA) X-Ray images with corresponding instance segmentation labels, provided by two dentists with radialogical domain expertise. The labels comprise 8 classes of pathologies and restaurations, namely XXXX. The dataset is intended for non-commercial academic use and released under GNU lesser GPL. The aim of Dantset is on one hand to foster the development of computer vision and machine learning algorithms for dental X-Ray imaging. On the other hand, Dantset contributes to the general variety of computer vision datasets, independently of domain of application. With its composition of 8 classes, Dantset contributes a new landmark with respect to problem complexity, being located in a low-density regime of the general computer vision dataset landscape.
